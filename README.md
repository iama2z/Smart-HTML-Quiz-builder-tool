Smart Quiz Builder
The Smart Quiz Builder is a simple, powerful tool designed to streamline the creation of interactive HTML quizzes for the classroom. It allows you to take a quiz from a PDF, extract its content, and generate a detailed prompt for an AI to build a web-based, auto-grading version of that quiz.

This system is designed to save time on manual data entry and repetitive coding, allowing you to focus on creating great content for your students.

How It Works
The workflow is divided into two main parts:

The Prompt Generator (Smart_Quiz_Builder.html): This is a standalone webpage that reads your PDF and creates a set of instructions for an AI.

The Data Receiver (Google Apps Script): This is a script connected to a Google Sheet that acts as a permanent "mailbox," automatically collecting and organizing student results from any quiz you generate.

Instructions for Use
Follow these steps to create a new quiz from a PDF.

Step 1: Open the Smart Quiz Builder
Open the Smart_Quiz_Builder.html file in your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

Step 2: Fill in Quiz Details
Quiz Title: Give your quiz a unique name (e.g., "Cell Division Quiz"). This name will be used for the new tab in your Google Sheet.

Quiz Description: Add a brief description for your students.

Step 3: Upload Your Quiz PDF
Drag and drop your quiz PDF file onto the upload area, or click the area to select the file from your computer.

The tool will automatically read the PDF and display the extracted text in the "Extracted Text" box. Review the text to ensure it was read correctly.

Step 4: Generate and Copy the Prompt
Click the "Generate Prompt from PDF Text" button.

A complete, detailed prompt will appear at the bottom of the page.

Click the "Copy to Clipboard" button to copy the entire prompt.

Step 5: Use the Prompt with an AI
Paste the copied prompt into your preferred AI chat interface (like Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.).

The AI will generate the complete HTML code for your new, interactive quiz.

Step 6: Save and Share
Copy the HTML code generated by the AI.

Paste it into a new text file and save it with an .html extension (e.g., cell_division_quiz.html).

You can now share this HTML file with your students or embed it on a website.

The generated quiz is now fully connected to your Google Sheet and will automatically send student results to the correct tab.
